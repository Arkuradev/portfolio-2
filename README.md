# Portfolio 2

This is my **Portfolio 2** project, showcasing three larger assignments completed during my studies at Noroff. 
The portfolio is build as a multi-page website, where each project has its own dedicated article page with live links, documentation and reflections.

## Portfolio 2 - Class assignment

This page was made as part of a class assignment at Noroff. This assignment had a 2 week deadline to complete. Near the end of this README I have have added ```Future Improvements``` as with more time I would have managed to make some really impactful changes to each project. 

## Projects featured

### 1. MemeSpot (CSS Frameworks)

A meme feed application built with JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. 

**Key improvements:**

* Debounced search to reduce unnecessary API calls. 
* Skeleton loaders inside the feed instead of a global loader when searching.
* Improved authentication UX with a login gate.

### 2. Online Shop (JavaScript Frameworks)

A modern online shop built for the JavaScript Frameworks class assignment, focusing on component structure and a clear user flow. 

**Key improvements:**

* Cleaner layout and component organization.
* Improved navigation and UI consistency.
* Correct deployment and routing configuration on Vercel.

An auction platform built with JavaScript, allowing users to browse listings, view details and place bids. Users can also create auctions and sell to other users on the site. 

**Key improvements:** 

 * UI and layout refinements for better readability.
 * Improved card styling and placement on pages.

## Reflection

This portfolio represents a consolidation of my learning across multiple class assignments at Noroff Vocational School studying Front-end development. 
The focus for Portfolio 2 was not adding new features, but **improving usability**, **structure** and **presentation** as well as documenting and presenting the work professionally.

## Future Improvements

With more time on the assignment and/or at my own time I would have made some additional improvements to each project if these where the projects I would use for my job searching portfolio.

### Memespot

* Improve the search field, add filter options for easier searches. 
* Finish the polish for all pages. 
* Update UI to look more premium and complete.
* Remake the loader functionality to use mostly skeleton loaders and have the global loader not take over the page during loading. 

### JS Frameworks / Online Shop

* Add authentication so users can create accounts and go through the shopping experience like a real e-commerce shop. 
* Add functionality for users to track their orders, change their profile settings. 
* Change the theme of the site to be more e-commerce and look more professional. 
* Improve search and filtering of products. 


### Semester Project 2 / CrestAuction

* Add more themes, improve UX by not rendering default theme first as page is being refreshed.
* Make the page more interesting by adding content to places to make the page feel more alive. Examples: Showing listings with little time left, show listings with alot of attention and present listings in a better way. 
* Add some imagery and/ color patterns that would fit the make and feel of the web site to give a solid feeling of "This is THE auction site".
* Improve on account information, what user can track. 
* Improve search and filtering.


The changes listed here is just what I thought about during these 2 weeks, I am sure if I spent more time on each project I would find more things I would like to improve upon. On a real project one thing I would strive for was to recieve user feedback, as that is incredibly valuable in order to create a website/app that checks the boxes for the users.
